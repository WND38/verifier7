# verifier7
A tool that may (or may not) fix your Windows 7 driver problems. 

* May not work with better hardware (Windows 10 or newer)
* Destined to people that still struggle with Windows 7 laptop problems
* I'm new at coding, so any help is so much welcome.

# What does this tool have? 

* Python 3.4.2 32-bits.
* Using commands like subprocess.run makes it runnable in older PCs
* Destined to people that just installed Windows 7 and want their drives up and monitored.
* This tool is in PT-BR language natively, other versions will have English language.
* THIS TOOL CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY FIX YOUR DRIVER'S PROBLEMS, so make sure you have the right files to fix them, i'll try to implement auto fixes in the next version, though.

That's it! Hope you guys enjoy that python script. My discord is wnd32 and im almost always there.
